# File and documentation rules

- Read the applicable `AGENTS.md` and `index.md` before editing; read the
  active YouTrack Epic/Story/Task (`rules/youtrack.md`) instead of a
  `plan.md` file — that workflow is retired.
- Use `apply_patch` for repository edits. Do not write files with shell
  redirection, heredocs, Python scripts, or ad-hoc generators.
- Preserve established domain distinctions such as observed state versus
  desired intent; the active YouTrack issue and linked ADR Articles define
  task-specific names.
- Public types, traits, methods, capability flags, and enum variants require
  rustdoc and exports from the intended facade/module.
- Update English and Russian README/architecture documents together when the
  changed concept appears in both.
- Changes to behavior also require CHANGELOG, SUPPORT, SECURITY, and
  CONTRIBUTING review when their status or support statements are affected.
- Do not edit generated `target/` content or include local working files in
  published crate sources. Never reference or link YouTrack issue/article IDs
  (e.g. `TL-1`, `TL-A-7`) from README, CHANGELOG, ARCHITECTURE, SUPPORT,
  SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, or rustdoc — a reader without YouTrack access
  cannot resolve the link; restate the relevant fact inline instead.
- Each crate has its own local `README.md`; crate READMEs must not use relative
  links to the repository root because crates.io does not support those links.
- A crate README must stand alone on crates.io: explain purpose, intended
  audience, main surface, a valid usage example, feature/platform constraints,
  and privilege or safety requirements where applicable.
- After every repository change, scan and synchronize all relevant `*.md`
  files, including English/Russian counterparts, changelog, support, security,
  architecture, and contribution docs. Also inspect relevant extensionless
  project files such as `Cargo.toml`, `SECURITY`, `SUPPORT`, `.gitignore`, CI
  YAML, and scripts when the change affects packaging, workflow, or policy.
- Documentation review is complete only when no stale version, roadmap,
  feature, API, package-metadata, or support statement remains in the affected
  files. Record what was reviewed as a comment on the active YouTrack issue,
  even when no edit was needed.
