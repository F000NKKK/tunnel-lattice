# Tunnel Lattice project index

Cross-platform Rust library for TUN/TAP tunnel interfaces, designed to compose with the rest of the Lattice networking stack.

This repository is in the bootstrap stage: base repository workflow,
policies, and packaging are in place, but the crate(s) below are placeholders
with no implementation yet. Architecture and roadmap documents
(`ARCHITECTURE.md` / `ARCHITECTURE.ru.md`) will be added in a future session
once the design is decided; do not assume any roadmap stage from this file.

## Lattice ecosystem

Tunnel Lattice is one crate in the Lattice networking ecosystem:

```text
net-lattice      OS networking inspection/configuration (routes, DNS, interfaces)
tunnel-lattice   TUN/TAP tunnel interfaces
dns-lattice      Programmable DNS control plane
flow-lattice     Policy compiler: rules -> platform-neutral network plans
sdk-lattice      Application-facing SDK composing the crates above
```

Cross-crate dependency direction and API boundaries have not been decided yet
and will be recorded in this repository's architecture documents and ADRs
once that design work happens.

## Current status

No release has been published yet. There is no roadmap stage to report here;
see `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SUPPORT.md` for current project status language.
