# Contributing to Tunnel Lattice

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tunnel Lattice.

## Project Status

Tunnel Lattice is in the bootstrap stage: repository workflow, policies, and
packaging scaffolding are in place, ported from
[net-lattice](https://github.com/F000NKKK/net-lattice). No implementation code
or public API exists yet. The most valuable contributions right now are:

- Feedback on the project's vision, scope, and roadmap (see [README.md](README.md))
- Discussion of API design and architecture for the first implementation stage
- Documentation and tooling improvements

Please check open issues and discussions before starting significant work, to
avoid duplicated effort.

2. Create a topic branch for your change.
3. Make your changes, following the conventions described below.
4. Open a pull request against `main` using the provided pull request template.

## Development Conventions

Tunnel Lattice follows standard Rust ecosystem conventions:

- Code must be formatted with `rustfmt`.
- Code must be free of `clippy` warnings.
- Public APIs must be documented.
- Changes must include appropriate tests.
- Every affected crate must retain a standalone crate-local README, and
  English/Russian project documentation must remain synchronized.
- Privileged network tests must be isolated, opt-in, and restore changed state.
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive.
